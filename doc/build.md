# Building and Running (Work in Progress)

Building and running instructions are likely to change as I learn and
experiment. The best place for now is to peek at the source code for the latest
state of affairs.

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo
- Protobuf compiler

## Building

### Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vijayanant/confer.git
   ```
### Build the project 
   
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

This should build both the server, client lib, and the CLI.
